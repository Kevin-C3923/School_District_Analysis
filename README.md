# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to examine and create charts for all schools in the district by there average in math & reading and 
the overall passing rate for each subject in both individually and combine. Addtionally, we determine the schools 
performance depending on the difference between schools grade, the amount spended on student, the school size, 
and the type of school they were.

However, it was informed that Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading grades showed evidence of academic dishonesty. 
Not knowing the full extent, it was choosen to remove all the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School and to recreate all
the charts that were made before the academic dishonesty was discovered.
