# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to examine and create charts for all schools in the district by there average in math & reading and the overall passing rate for each subject in both individually and combine. Addtionally, we determine the schools performance depending on the difference between schools grade, the amount spended on student, the school size, and the type of school they were.

However, it was informed that Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading grades showed evidence of academic dishonesty. Not knowing the full extent, it was choosen to remove all the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School and to recreate all the charts that were made before the academic dishonesty was discovered.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Even do we removed the 9th grades math and reading for Thomas High School’s, the difference between other school isn't major. The average, passing for Math & Reading, and the overall did change by a ~0.1 - ~0.2 percentage but the difference wasn't so big that another school would jump ahead. It was still able to maintain second place for overall passing.

## Summary	
With the replacement of the ninth grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School, some changes can be seen. For the district summary, the average of math and passing overall decreased by 0.1, while passing in math went down by 0.2 and in reading it went down by 0.3. This can also be seen in the school summary, as Thomas High school average's and passing's went down about ~0.1 to ~0.3. When it came to the Math and Reading scores by grade, the only difference is that Thomas High school 9th grade has NaN and doesn't allow us compare there 9th grade overall to other schools. However, when it came to Scores by school spending, size and type in the charts above you don't see any difference that Thomas High school would have affected. The reason for this was that the changes/difference were about ~0.01 to ~0.03 and we were informed to round up to the nearest tenth, so does differences are not showen.
